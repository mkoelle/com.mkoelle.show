              About 6000 years ago the first pin based locks were created, now
              these aren't the first security systems ever mind you, but to go
              into the awesome arts of knot tying, or clay seals, would take us
              more time than we have. so here we are with a device that can only
              be opened when all the pins are lifted and the key would rely on
              the correct spacing of the pins on the comb.

              You might also be able to open this with the correct application
              of a hatchet. but I suspect that the salesmen of the time would
              say something along the lines of "However the lock is invincible
              to the people who do not have a hatchet." but we'll get back to
              that extra: [in the] "Roman Empire, where it was further adapted
              to smaller locks that could secure chests and drawers. Apparently,
              affluent Romans would wear their keys like rings so that other
              patricians would know that they were rich enough to own things
              that needed protection."

              Middle Ages, when English craftsman made the first all-metal
              warded locks. Now some time has passed, and we enter into a new
              age, the pin locks have disappeared for now and the new rage is
              warded locks, these locks are more about turning a device and
              setting free a lever.

              A cool benefit of these locks is that you can create set of keys
              that open different combinations of locks. so on your castle, you
              have a castle right? you can give your cook a key to the kitchen,
              and your doorman a key to the front door, and you would have a key
              that can get you into both, and your room! this would be the
              skeleton key of course, practical but insecure, as knowledge of
              the shape of the lock would be enough to craft a wire to trip the
              lever. https://locksmiths-worthing.com/warded-locks/

              But everything changed in 1770s with the arrival of an inventor
              named Joseph Bramah to the English locksmithing scene. Bramah was
              a polymath engineer who would come to be known as one of the
              fathers of pneumatic power. But he also applied his talents toward
              improving locks. He created a lock that was vastly superior to any
              the world ever seen. His so-called Bramah safety lock had layers
              of complexity in between the key and the deadbolt that Bramah
              believed made it 100 percent theftproof. Bramah was so confident
              in his design that he published a pamphlet detailing exactly how
              it worked.

              The British government wanted to up the game; it wanted a lock
              that wouldn't just be unbreakable, but would also alert the owner
              if someone tried to open it. Another locksmith named Jeremiah
              Chubb met that challenge with his Chubb detector lock. The
              government awarded Chubb 100 pounds ($147) for his innovation.

              Bramah had died by this point, and his sons were running his shop.
              They gave Hobbs a room above the store where could stay for 30
              days while he worked on the lock. He was allowed to set it up
              however he wanted and use all his own tools. Monitors came to
              check in on him periodically. After working on the lock for about
              52 hours over the course of 14 days, Hobbs opened the Bramah
              safety lock.

            "In 1843, Linus Yale Sr. patented his pin and tumbler lock, now
            known simply as the Yale lock. The design was essentially an
            improvement on the simple wooden tumbler lock created by the
            Egyptians. Linus Yale Jr. improved upon the design in 1861,
            inventing the now ubiquitous flat grooved key with notches on the
            edges. This is probably the same type of lock you have on your front
            door."
